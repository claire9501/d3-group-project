## Earthquake Weather: Myth or Reality?

#### Team: 
* Rona Bourdeau
* Jackie Song
* Christian Pompa

### Objective: 
We wish to prove or disprove the concept or "Earthquake Weather".  We define earthquake weather as a significant change in temperature from the day of the quake and the day preceding it.  We will review earthquakes from the past month as well as signifiant earthquakes in the past decade with a magnitude of 4.5+. We will use the latitude and longitude of the earthquake to get the corresponding temperature on the day of the earthquake as well as 3 days before the earthquake. Afterwards, we will analyze if a correlation exists between the significant change in temperature and the occurrence of an earthquake.
